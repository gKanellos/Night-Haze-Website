This speculative 360 video evolution takes an area on campus and starts with it being in a natural surrounding. There are no signs of humanity or human development. It then evolves to what the area looks like today during the night. Finally, it evolves to a representation of reduced light pollution. Some of the street lights are taken out and the intensity of the lights are reduced. There are also sounds that correlate with each scene. The nature surrounding is paired with cricket noises, the fully light scene has the sound of traffic, and the partially lit scene has mixture of both.
