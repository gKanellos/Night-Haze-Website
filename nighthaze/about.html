Our night skies used to be filled with stars, planets and galaxies. Now, we have grown accustomed to living under a dome of reflected, refracted light called light pollution. Light pollution has impinged on and influenced various areas of life on earth, from wildlife to human health. Night Haze explores this phenomenon through research in public opinion and education. The project uses Augmented Reality (AR) as a learning tool through a coded University of Southern California map that the user scans while exploring under a light polluted sky. The research-driven website uses data visualizations to demonstrate how individuals at USC understand, view and are impacted by light pollution. It additionally serves as a platform from which to educate people, industry and governments on how and why to reduce the effects of light pollution. As humanity continues to develop, reducing light pollution is necessary for conservation and well being, and it will back the night sky.
